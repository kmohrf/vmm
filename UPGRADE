If you still have installed vmm 0.3.x you have to proceed this step first:

    * upgrade your vmm installation to version 0.4-r41


If you have installed vmm 0.4/0.4-r41 you have to proceed this steps:

    * stop Postfix and Dovecot
    * backup/dump your database.
    * backup/dump your database!

    * start psql and connect to the appropriate database
      (ex. psql mailsys mailsys vmm -W -h localhost)
    * update the database: \i update_tables_0.4.x-0.5.pgsql
    * GRANT SELECT ON postfix_alias TO postfix;
                                       ^^^^^^^^ <- your Postfix db user


  Dovecot v1.2.x
    -> Are you already using Dovecot v1.2.x?
       * update the database for Dovecot v1.2.x:
         \i update_tables_0.5.x_for_dovecot-1.2.x.pgsql
       * GRANT SELECT ON dovecot_password TO dovecot;
                                             ^^^^^^^^ <- your Dovecot db user

       * When you are using the SQL function »dovecotpassword()« in your
         dovecot-sql.conf, update it also:
         \i update_types_and_functions_0.5.x_for_dovecot-1.2.x.pgsql

       * You have also to adjust the permissions of the set-uid deliver copy:
         on BSD:
           chgrp nobody /usr/local/lib/dovecot/deliver
         on Linux:
           chgrp nogroup /usr/local/lib/dovecot/deliver
         chmod u+s,o-rwx /usr/local/lib/dovecot/deliver

       * Check the master.cf from Postfix.
         In prior setups the service dovecot was configured slightly different.
         If you have set the command attribute 'user' to 'nobody:mail', so
         either remove the group mail or replace it with the group nobody
         or nogroup.

         e.g.: flags=DRhu user=nobody argv=/usr/local/lib/dovecot/deliver …

    * execute upgrade.sh

    * start Dovecot and Postfix



If you have installed vmm 0.5.x:

    * execute upgrade.sh

    -> Are you already using Dovecot v1.2.x?
       See a few lines above.


else
     * read INSTALL
